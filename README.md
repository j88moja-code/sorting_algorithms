# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Contents

* [sort.h]() - the header file with all the libraries, prototypes for functions and data structures used in this project.
* [print_array.c]() - function that prints an array of integers.
* [print_list.c]() - a function that prints a list of integers.

## ``mandatory tasks``

* [0-bubble_sort.c]() - a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm.
* [0-O]() - the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line: in the best case, in the average case and in the worst case.
* [1-insertion_sort_list.c]() - a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm.
* [1-O]() - the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line: in the best case, in the average case and in the worst case.
